# MachineLearning with Sklearn

Run main.py and you'll see the magic.

Main features (till now):
- choose between different classifiers (just 2 for now: SVC and RandomForest, easy to add others)
- choose between different datasets (3 available but you can add more)
- choose if you want to split the dataset into training-testing or use two different data sets
- some simple but cool input validation to check dataset compatibility
